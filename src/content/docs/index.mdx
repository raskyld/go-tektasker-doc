## Introduction: The Lovers 🦢

The following video shows the workflow of building a Tekton Task with `go-tektasker`
using the default project generated by the CLI. The goal is to produce a task that takes
two parameters `lover1` and `lover2` and write back in a result a little sentence that
claim the love of the two parameters!

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Task Development" icon="laptop">
		`tektasker init` will generate a project with a
        [TaskFile](https://taskfile.dev) providing the glue between
        the different components involved in task creation.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Manifest as a Service" icon="document">
		Do you enjoy writing YAML? Me neither. Let Tektasker
        write your Tekton Task CRD so you don't have to 😌
	</Card>
	<Card title="Fast dev workflow" icon="rocket">
		Once you've configured Tektasker all you need is one
        `task apply` to build and ship your Task to your development
        cluster.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Kustomize!" icon="add-document">
		The generated manifest for your Task doesn't comply with your
        Kubernetes cluster policy? Tektasker will generate a base
        Kustomization. All that is left to do is writing overlays.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Don't leave your IDE" icon="bars">
		My goal with this project is to allow you to stay in your IDE
        as much as possible. You can do a lot writing only Go code 😏
