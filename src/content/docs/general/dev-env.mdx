title: Development Environment
description: How to use Tektasker's Dev Env?
---

## Structure

New projects scaffolded using `go-tektasker init` come with an opinionated
development environment.

It is composed of:
- a `.env` file, allowing you to customize the behavior of the environment.
- a `Taskfile.yaml` file that is an equivalent of makefiles, see [TaskFile][taskfile]
  for more information.

## Usage

We tried to make the development environment as simple as possible
so you can understand it quickly and tune it to your taste. This is why we chose
[Taskfile][taskfile] over of *GNU Make*: the YAML spec should be simpler to
understand.

### Tasks

- `task` shows the status of your dev env and list available tasks.
- `task status` shows the status of your dev env, this is useful to ensure you have
  all dependencies installed.
- `task manifest` generates your task's YAML manifest.
- `task generate` generates go helper code for your params and results.
- `task apply` generates everything and apply your task using the configured context.

## Configuration

All configuration options are documented in the `.env` file.

## Requirements

Please, see the [installation instructions](/general/installation/#tektaskers-development-environment).

### Kubernetes Cluster

Indeed, a Kubernetes cluster with Tekton Pipelines installed is needed.
You also need to be able to push container images to a registry this cluster can pull from.

The recommended setup is:
- Use a local Kubernetes environment for development (e.g. KinD, Rancher Desktop, ...)
- Integrate Tektasker in your deployment process (CI/CD, GitOps, ...) for production.

:::note
We recommend setting `APPLY_CONTEXT` in `.env` to the Kubernetes context that
should be used for development, otherwise, `task apply` will use the current
context which could lead to mistakes.
:::

#### KinD

You only need to change `KO_DOCKER_REPO` to `kind.local` so `ko` loads your task
container image directly to your KinD cluster.

Note though that `ko` will, by default, try to load the image into the default
(`kind`) cluster, if you want to use a specific named KinD cluster, you need to
specify the name with `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME`. To know more, see
[`ko` documentation][ko-local].

Enjoy!

#### Rancher Desktop

By default, `KO_DOCKER_REPO` is set to `ko.local` which instructs `ko` to use
the local docker socket to push the image.

Be sure your Rancher Desktop is using the default `/var/run/docker.sock` or use
`DOCKER_HOST` to make `ko` communicates with the correct Docker socket.
