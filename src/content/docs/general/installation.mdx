## Dependencies

### Tektasker as a standalone

**Tektasker** can be used as a standalone tool to:
- Generate YAML manifest from your Go package `go-tektasker gen manifest`
- Generate Go helper code for your types marked as params, results and other Tekton construct
  with `go-tektasker gen go`
- Scaffold a base project with a Taskfile providing an opinionated development environment `go-tektasker init`

All you need for that is to have `go` installed.

### Tektasker's development environment

If you want to use the opinionated development environment provisioned by `go-tektasker init`, you will need
the following dependencies.

:::note
There is an open issue [#28](https://github.com/raskyld/go-tektasker/issues/28) whose goal is
to ease the installation of requirements. Do not hesitate to contribute either by sharing
your ideas or opening a PR.
:::

#### `kubectl`

You need kubectl to `apply` the task to your cluster.

#### A Kubernetes cluster with Tekton Pipelines

You need a Kubernetes Cluster with Tekton installed.

**Tektasker** dev env has been tested against the following local kubernetes environment solutions:
- Rancher Desktop
- KinD
